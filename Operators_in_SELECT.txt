1) Write out a generic SELECT statement.
SELECT date
FROM transactions
WHERE amount >= 500;

2) Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.

A:SFW or single family what also SELECT FROM WHERE.

3) Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:

Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column may have multiple words (for example, "Labrador Collie mix").

Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.
SELECT name, age, gender
FROM dogs
WHERE breed LIKE '%labrador%';

Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.
SELECT id
FROM dogs
WHERE age < 1;

Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.
SELECT name, age
FROM dogs
WHERE gender = 'F'
AND weight > 35;

Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.
SELECT *
FROM dogs
WHERE breed NOT LIKE '%shepherd%';

Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.
SELECT id, age, weight, breed
FROM dogs
WHERE weight > 60
OR breed = '%great dane%';

4) Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?

SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats; The name and adoption dates of all cats.
SELECT name, age FROM cats; The name and age of all cats.

5) From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.
Display all the information about all of the available cats.
SELECT *
FROM cats;
WHERE adoption_date = NULL

Display the name and sex of all cats who are 7 years old.
SELECT name, gender
FROM cats
WHERE age = 7;

Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.
SELECT name
FROM cats;

6) List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.

A: < less than if i needed to find transaction that were less than 100. > greater than if I needed to find transactions greater than 100. <= less than or equal to I want to see all the houses that were built in 2000 or earlier. >= greater than or equal to where i want to find all the houses built in 2010 and later. != does not equal where I want to see everything except items with the id number of 5. = means equal to show me all the results in the table that equal 10 in the age column.

7) From the cats table, what data is returned from these queries?
SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = ‘F’;
name
Seashell
Nala

SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age <> 3;
name
Mushi
Seashell
Victoire
Nala

SELECT ID FROM cats WHERE name != ‘Mushi’ AND gender = ‘M’;
id
3
4
